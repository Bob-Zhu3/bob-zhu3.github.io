				<div class="meta mb-1">Wrote these serendipitously</div>
			    <section>
				</br></br>
					<div>

						<h5>Identity</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">16 Jun 2023</div>
						<p>
							Everyone knows his happiness, except himself.</br>
						</br>
							"Who?" "The part one of you."</br>
						</br>
							With the mirror, I feel alive.

						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Resilience</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">16 Jun 2023</div>
						<p>
							The poor men's tears are water.
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Into the Night</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">16 Jun 2023</div>
						<p>
							Sunset slumbers half of the souls.</br>
						</br>
							"Good night." "Homework's due at midnight."
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Hide and Seek</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">8 Jun 2023</div>
						<p>
							I play hide and seek with myself</br>
							I hide pretty well</br>
							It's been over twenty years</br>
							Yet I haven't been found
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Mother</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">14 May 2023</div>
						<p>
							He said I was a diamond, sparkling</br>
							They said I was mud in the gutter;</br>
							But only she said,</br>
							Being a little pebble was enough.
						</p>

			
					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Repentance</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">16 Feb 2023</div>
						<p>
							Every time I fell into depravity,</br>
							I carved the word "strive" on my room's walls.</br>
						</br>
							When I died,</br>
							People surveyed my room.</br>
						</br>
							The walls covered in "strive,"</br>
							Resembling ancient inscriptions of some kind.
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Sunset</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">2 Jan 2023</div>
						<p>
							Sunset is a solemn affair.</br>
							Half the planet's souls</br>
							Is about to slumber for it.
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Grown Up</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">1 Jan 2023</div>
						<p>
							When I was young,</br>
							Looked down, looked up,</br>
							Not knowing what I was searching for.</br>
						</br>
							When I grew up,</br>
							Looked up, looked down,</br>
							Forgetting what I was striving for.
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>No title</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">24 Dec 2022</div>
						<p>
							I surrender to my desires,</br>
							And dress them in a cloak of romance.
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Roasted Sweet Potato</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">1 Oct 2022</div>
						<p>
							Something orange falls down,</br>
							Something orange rises up,</br>
							But for a hungry me,</br>
							They're all the same.
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Alarm</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">24 Sep 2022</div>
						<p>
							The day hasn't dawned yet,</br>
							The alarm for work goes off.</br>
							The day hasn't dawned yet,</br>
							The alarm for the end of work doesn't go off either.
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Loneliness</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">23 Aug 2022</div>
						<p>
							Breaking through the southern wall of Survival</br>
							But found that living is a labyrinth</br>
							Escaping from the living's labyrinth</br>
							But found that life is a besieged city
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>My Stars</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">23 Jul 2022</div>
						<p>
							I often gaze at the stars from the rooftop of the teaching building,</br>
							But in the downward direction.
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Letter</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">16 Jul 2022</div>
						<p>
							The snow-covered ground is a message from afar,</br>
							Signed with a few strokes of forlorn sparrows.
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Reason</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">1 Jun 2022</div>
						<p>
							As a child, I always asked my parents why.</br>
							As I grew up, my parents always asked me why.
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Monkey</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">24 Mar 2022</div>
						<p>
							In the jungle of steel and concrete,</br>
							I search for a vine of freedom.
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Secret</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">22 Mar 2022</div>
						<p>
							Today, my friend discovered a secret of mine.</br>
							But with so much sincerity, what secret can I possibly hold?</br>
						</br>
							I asked them what the secret was,</br>
							They smiled without saying a word.</br>
						</br>
							I asked again: What is the secret?</br>
							They burst into laughter.</br>
						</br>
							Haha, I also laughed,</br>
							My secret has become everyone's secret.
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Whispers of Destiny</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">19 Feb 2022</div>
						<p>
							Life and the path of life inexplicably intersect and run parallel,</br>
							Existence and the random tranquility of existence are steady yet extreme.</br>
							The vast sea that the little boat seeks has always been here,</br>
							It's just that in the past, there were rebellions and evasions, each self-justified.</br>
						</br>
							There have been trembling, sharp sword strikes, and struggles with shattered chess pieces,</br>
							Also, through countless nights and experienced all four seasons.</br>
							Loki's promises become detestable,</br>
							In Aphrodite's whispers, I see the self I desperately want to express.</br>
						</br>
							The boredom of restlessness cannot withstand the escape from reality,</br>
							Each search is just a straw raincoat in the downpour.</br>
							Turning back, unable to grasp the vividness of camellia blossoms,</br>
							Silence is just my response, my humble tribute.</br>
						</br>
							Using time to dilute is not the foundation of problem-solving,</br>
							Respecting commitments is the premise for lasting bonds.</br>
							No need to question the opportune, no need to evade,</br>
							Confronting oneself is my ultimate suggestion.</br>
						</br>
							I don't want to criticize cognitive deviations,</br>
							For even the author can't tell if this is delusion or true intent.</br>
							There are indeed differences between people,</br>
							At least I'm grateful for my decisiveness and pride.</br>
						</br>
							Can we bid farewell to inconsistencies in words and actions?</br>
							I stand under the setting sun, gazing at the horizon and sighing:</br>
							When did arrogance and recklessness grow on my land?
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Human</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">7 Feb 2022</div>
						<p>
							I open my eyes,</br>
							They say this is brightness.</br>
							I open my mouth wide,</br>
							They say this is freedom.</br>
							I wave my hand,</br>
							They say this is happiness.</br>
							I take a step forward,</br>
							They say this is progress.</br>
						</br>
							I open my eyes, open my mouth, wave my hand, take a step,</br>
							But they say I want to devour people.</br>
							So,</br>
							I have to bend down.										
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Mashed Potatoes</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">14 Jan 2022</div>
						<p>
							I am but a humble potato,</br>
							Yesterday, lying in the soil,</br>
							Bantering with earthworms,</br>
							Whistling a tune,</br>
							Teasing passing butterfly maidens.</br>
							On sunny days, I revel in carefree grass, dancing,</br>
							On rainy days, I howl in wild, disarray with unkempt hair.</br>
						</br>
							But now, as I awaken from slumber,</br>
							Encased in a coarse burlap sack,</br>
							Squeezed among countless potatoes,</br>
							Each with a weary countenance, aloof and indifferent.</br>
						</br>
							Like prisoners,</br>
							Lined up for the assault of water guns,</br>
							For the first time, I see clearly,</br>
							My own pockmarked and speckled existence.</br>
							Oh, how wretched I am.</br>
						</br>
							Silence,</br>
							A thousand arrows piercing my heart,</br>
							I realize, I am but a lowly potato.
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Umbrella</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">2 Jan 2022</div>
						<p>
							I wanted to become a swordsman</br>
							Umbrella, my sword</br>
							The battle was intense</br>
							I was defeated, and the umbrella was broken</br>
							I bought a new umbrella</br>
							But the rain</br>
							Stopped.
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>The Corner</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">28 Dec 2021</div>
						<p>
							I stand in the corner of a cliff,</br>
							Contemplating whether the sky is larger or the earth is larger.</br>
							Later, I come to think that perhaps it is I who is the largest,</br>
							For they overlook the insignificant me,</br>
							I should also disregard the grandiose them.
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>The Death of the Potsticker</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">3 Dec 2021</div>
						<p>
							Why am I so heartbroken</br>
							When the potsticker dies?</br>
						</br>
							It slipped suddenly</br>
							From between two black chopsticks</br>
							Its eyes filled with despair</br>
							In the end</br>
							The earth held its captive</br>
							I can feel the bone-chilling cold behind it</br>
							It lost its life</br>
							No longer the steaming vibrant potsticker</br>
							It is tainted by the soil</br>
						</br>
							Why am I so heartbroken</br>
							When the potsticker dies?</br>
						</br>
							I saw</br>
							Its eyes filled with despair</br>
							Perhaps blaming me</br>
							For not giving it a resting place sooner</br>
							Will it resent me</br>
							For leaving it so cold</br>
							In its moment of death</br>
						</br>
							My heart, too, seems enveloped in coldness</br>
							Just when the potsticker dies
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Coincidence</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">2 Dec 2021</div>
						<p>
							You are one in a billion</br>
							The sky, the corridors choose you</br>
							The palaces adorned with oil paintings choose you</br>
							The churches choose you</br>
							Every vine-wrapped</br>
							Summer night's small lamp, the shadows of evening tea</br>
							Choose you</br>
						</br>
							You are one in a billion</br>
							And I choose you too</br>
							All my philosophical thoughts, dreams</br>
							The nightly melodies of the piano</br>
							All choose you</br>
							With my one and only life</br>
							I choose the world of solitude</br>
							Conch shells, the sound of waves, and you
						</p>


					</br></br></br>
						<h5>Rectification</h5>
						<div class="meta mb-1">1 Dec 2021</div>
						<p>
							In the summertime,</br>
							Flies buzzing incessantly,</br>
							People grew furious,</br>
							"What audacious flies,</br>
							Disturbing our peaceful dreams!"</br>
							People picked up insecticides,</br>
							And then,</br>
							Killed the innocent ladybug.
